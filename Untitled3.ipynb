            "[3] On 02 December 2022, one of the Applicant’s representatives, Mr. Mbhekiseni\n",
            "Vivian Mfeka, went to the Commission’s offices in Mtubatuba branch where he was issued\n",
            "with an invoice for payment of a deposit into the Commission’s Standard Bank account\n",

            "candidates including the payment of the required deposit of R1000.00 was 17h00 on 5\n",
            "December 2022.\n",
            "[4] After receiving the invoice, Mr. Mfeka went to effect payment at Standard Bank.\n",
            "There, he was assisted by one of the bank’s officials. Upon inserting the bank account\n",
            "number, the system reflected Bayport Financial Services, as the recipient, with an\n",
            "account number (401765148) that is different from the one that he was given by the4\n",
            "Commission. However, they proceeded to make payment even though Mr. Mfeka had\n",
            "queried the said account number from the bank official as it showed an unfamiliar name.\n",
            "[5] On 12 December 2022, the Commission wrote to the Applicant informing them that\n",
            "the deposit of Mr. Mfeka does not reflect in their system and therefore their candidate was\n",
            "disqualified to contest the by-elections. According to the Applicant, while Mr. Mfeka tried\n",

            "candidate was eligible to contest the by-elections.\n",
            "[6] The payment was eventually transferred from Bayport Financial Services account\n",

            "Brothers Investments (Pty) Ltd and Others2, the Constitutional Court, said the following:\n",
